# FP - Second Project

The second project of the FP class (Foundations of Programming).

The goal of the project was to create a Human vs. Computer Nine men's morris game.
You can play the game via the command line.

The project was written in Python and explored the basics concepts of the language and programming in general.

# How to run

To run the project, run `python3 -i Projeto2FP.py` and call the function `moinho(*player*, *difficulty*)`, where `player` is either `"[X]"` or `"[O]"` and `difficulty` is either `"facil"`, `"normal"` or `"dificil"` (easy, normal and hard, respectively).
